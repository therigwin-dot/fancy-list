## **Objective**
Clean up the title code section by removing divider control and its default settings to simplify the codebase.

- ✅ No divider spacing control in property pane

- ✅ No divider spacing defaults in configuration
- ✅ No divider spacing properties in web part

### **Verification Results**

- ✅ Font controls (family, size, formatting, alignment)
- ✅ Background color picker
- ✅ Text color picker
- ✅ Shape picker
- ✅ Divider toggle (simple on/off)
- ✅ Reset and Test Values buttons

### **No Action Required**
The codebase is already in a clean state without the problematic divider spacing control. The restoration to the previous commit successfully removed all the divider spacing complexity.

### **Ready for Next Steps**
The title section is now clean and ready for any new features or improvements without the divider spacing control complexity.
