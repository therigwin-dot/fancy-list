 * If this schema is updated, dependant schemas MUST also be updated, including the spfx-serve.schema.json.
 * The spfx-serve.schema.json is the serve.schema.json file with the spfx-specific properties included. The
 * merge is simple, but must be done manually whenever the serve.schema.json file is changed.
