# Fancy List Web Part - Design Document (Updated July 2025)

## Overview
Fancy List now supports only Individual Elements mode for styling. All other modes (JSON, CSS, Default, SharePoint Theme) have been removed for clarity and reliability.

## Key Design Features
- Property pane is organized in the visual order of the web part display.
- Title Section background supports transparent, solid, image, and gradient (with transparency controls).
- Image URL mode includes intelligent error handling with radial gradients and centered text.
- Divider lines can be toggled between title/Category Filters and Category Filters/lists.
- Category Filters (formerly Category Pills), category header, subject header, list area, and description all have their own styling controls.
- All changes live-update the preview; only a Reset button is present.

## User Experience
- Users configure all visual aspects in a single, intuitive mode.
- No more confusion between styling modes; all controls are always relevant.
- Immediate feedback for every change.
- Image URL mode provides clear visual feedback for empty/invalid URLs.

## Technical Approach
- All legacy styling mode code and parameters have been removed.
- Only Individual Elements mode and its controls remain in the property pane and codebase.
- All settings are mode-specific and update the preview live.
- Image transparency implemented with overlay system to maintain text visibility.

## Current Status
### âœ… Fully Functional:
- Page 1: List selection and configuration
- Page 2: Title Font controls, Title Section Background (all modes), Title Divider
- Image URL mode with error handling and transparency support

### ðŸ”„ Next Development Focus:
- Category Filters (formerly Category Pills) configuration and functionality
- Other section backgrounds (Category Header, Subject Header, Description)
- Transparency control consistency across all sections
