## **BENCHMARK TESTING PROCEDURE (Updated)**
When performing benchmark testing:
1. Restart Microsoft Edge (kill any existing Edge processes)
2. Wait 1 second
3. Launch Microsoft Edge to: `https://fbinsmi.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`

**Note:** No gulp serve process management is required for benchmark testing.

## RECENT MAJOR FIXES (January 2025)
### ‚úÖ **Re-rendering Issues Fixed**
- **Problem**: Jarring full web part re-renders on every property change
- **Solution**: Removed excessive `this.render()` calls and implemented conditional re-rendering
- **Result**: Smooth property updates without full refreshes

### ‚úÖ **Page 4 Dependency Issue Fixed**
- **Problem**: Pages 1, 2, 3 only worked correctly after visiting Page 4
- **Solution**: Added default initialization for `categorySectionSettings` in `onInit()`
- **Result**: All pages work correctly from the start

### ‚úÖ **Testing Convenience Added**
- **Problem**: Manual field selection required for testing
- **Solution**: Added "Test Defaults" button on Page 1 with automatic field population
- **Result**: One-click testing setup with Events list configuration
