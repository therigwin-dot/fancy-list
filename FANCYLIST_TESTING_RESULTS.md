# FULL FEATURE TESTING CHECKLIST (Updated Status - January 2025)

## **CURRENT BENCHMARK TEST - CATEGORY SECTION REFRESH FIX (July 2025)**

### **CRITICAL TEST FOCUS: Page 4 Category Section Configuration**
**Issue:** When Category Settings change, it refreshes both the Filter section and Categories.  
**Solution Needed:** Ensure only Category Section (Module Settings) updates live.  
**Expected Result:** Only Category section updates, Filter section stays static.

## BENCHMARK TESTING PROCEDURE (Updated)
When performing benchmark testing:
1. Restart Microsoft Edge (kill any existing Edge processes)
2. Wait 1 second
3. Launch Microsoft Edge to: `https://fbinsmi.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`

**Note:** No gulp serve process management is required for benchmark testing.

## RECENT MAJOR FIXES (January 2025)
### ✅ **Re-rendering Issues Fixed**
- **Problem**: Jarring full web part re-renders on every property change
- **Solution**: Removed excessive `this.render()` calls and implemented conditional re-rendering
- **Result**: Smooth property updates without full refreshes

### ✅ **Page 4 Dependency Issue Fixed**
- **Problem**: Pages 1, 2, 3 only worked correctly after visiting Page 4
- **Solution**: Added default initialization for `categorySectionSettings` in `onInit()`
- **Result**: All pages work correctly from the start

### ✅ **Testing Convenience Added**
- **Problem**: Manual field selection required for testing
- **Solution**: Added "Test Defaults" button on Page 1 with automatic field population
- **Result**: One-click testing setup with Events list configuration
