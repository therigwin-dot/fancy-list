# FancyList Modular UI Refactor Plan

## Overview
This plan details the step-by-step process to refactor the FancyList web part's UI controls (Color Picker, Background Picker, Font Control) into modular, reusable components. Testing is integrated after each step, with the Title section as the reference implementation. The Title section will be updated to use each new modular component as it is created. Code is backed up and can be reverted if issues arise.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### 1. Create Modular Color Picker Component **(Completed, no issues)**
- Extract the existing color picker logic into a new, self-contained component (e.g., `ColorPickerControl.tsx`).
- Parameters: `color`, `field`, `label`, `onChange`.
- Ensure it is reusable and independent.
- **Test:** Update the Title section to use the new Color Picker. Verify Title color selection works as before.

### 2. Create Modular Background Picker Component
- Build a new component (e.g., `BackgroundPickerControl.tsx`) that handles solid, image, and gradient backgrounds.
- Accepts: `defaultValues`, `fields`, `label`, `onChange`.
- Uses the modular Color Picker internally.
- Implements correct transparency logic (0 = solid, 100 = transparent).
- **Test:** Update the Title section to use the new Background Picker. Verify all Title background options work as before.

### 3. Create Modular Font Control Component
- Build a new component (e.g., `FontControl.tsx`) for font family, size, and formatting (Bold, Underline, StrikeThrough, Italics).
- Parameters: `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `formatting`, `onChange`.
- **Test:** Update the Title section to use the new Font Control. Verify Title font options work as before.

### 4. Refactor Other Sections
- Gradually replace color, background, and font controls in other property pane sections with the new modular components.
- **Test:** After each section is updated, verify both the updated section and the Title section work as expected.

### 5. Final Review
- Confirm all property pane controls use the modular components.
- Perform a final round of testing for all UI controls.

## Notes
- The Title section is always the first to be updated and tested with each new component.
- Testing is integrated after every change, not a separate phase.
- Code is backed up and can be reverted if needed.
